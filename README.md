# DE and particle velocity prediction CS_ML - Overview files
## DE_and_particle_velocity_prediction_CS_ML.ipynb
This script shows the pyhon code (jupyter notebook) used for the ML prediction models described in the manuscript: 
"Application of machine learning for the prediction of particle velocity distribution and deposition efficiency for cold spraying titanium powder".

Please execute the script in the same folder as h5 and joblib files.
